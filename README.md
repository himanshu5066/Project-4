Handset Feature Analysis and Price Prediction Dataset
Overview:-
This dataset is designed to analyze and predict handset prices based on various features. It contains detailed specifications of multiple handsets, including memory, RAM, battery capacity, camera features, processor type, and their respective prices. The primary objectives of the project include building a predictive model for handset prices and identifying key features influencing the pricing.
